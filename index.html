                The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983.
                The paperback edition was published by Corgi, an imprint of Transworld, in 1985. Pratchett's popularity
                increased when the BBC's Woman's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts, and later
                Equal Rites. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd,
                which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, Colin Smythe having become Pratchett's agent. Pratchett
                was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz.
