                            The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in the
                            German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following
                            year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from
                            the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss
                            citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to find work, from
                            1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. </p>

                                Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level
                                years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry
                                over a single summer.[23] Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the
                                Pythagorean theorem at age 12.[24] A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the
                                12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the
                                whole book.

                His Famous Quotes
            </h1>

            <blockquote>
                The years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alternations of confidence
                and exhaustion, and final emergence into light—only those who have experienced it can understand that.
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                Although I am a typical loner in daily life, my consciousness of belonging to the invisible community of
                those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has preserved me from feeling isolated.
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
