                    Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (About this soundlisten); 14 March
                    1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist[5] who developed the theory of relativity, one
                    of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][6] His work is also known for its
                    influence on the philosophy of science.[7][8] He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy
                    equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".

            the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
